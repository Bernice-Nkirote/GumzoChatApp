# GumzoChatApp
Gumzo chat app
Chat application with rooms and authentication using jsonweb token 
These are the technologies we have used to create this project: 
Nodejs - javascript runtime environment,
Javascript - to create dynamic functionality,
EJS - Allows javascript to be embedded into your HTML,  
Mongoose - to create schema and to add and extract data from the database,
Mongodb database - non relational database for our data,
Bootstrap and CSS - for styling,
SOCKET IO - to enable realtime communication between the server and the client.
The chat App is a simple application that allows communication between to users . I wanted to put into practice my Nodejs skill.
Feel free to add to the code or to advise if there is a way i can make the code better for my users.
